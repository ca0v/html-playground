## Visual SVG Editor

A keyboard-only SVG editor

## Generate documentation from the command tree

For example, press the following keys:

`/ t g` (slash toggle grid on)

`g` (toggle grid off)

`g` (toggle grid on)

`?` (show help)

`/` (slash returns to root commands, help still showing)

`/ f n` (slash file new)

`Tab` (trick to get to 1st item)

`/ p v` (slash path insert vertical line)

`s s s s` (increment Y, 4 times)

`h` (insert horizontal line)

`d d d d` (increment X, 4 times)

`,` (move to prior command)

`s s s s` (increment Y, 4 more times)

`.` (move to next command)

`d d d d` (increment X, 4 more times)

`/ f s` "Triangle" (file save as "Triangle")

`/ f n` (slash file new)

`/ f o` "Triangle" (re-open "Triangle")

TODO: there is no way to start editing until you click it

`[End]` (to to last command)

`,` (move to prior command)

`A` (insert Arc)

`<` (undo)

`>` (redo)

`w w w w a a a a` (move Arc)

`[Enter]` (edit the current command)

`/ t t` (toggle toolbar)

(etc...)

## Questions I have for Myself

- How to use relative function ("m" instead of "M")? Seems to not be implemented.
- How to copy the SVG to clipboard? Seems you have to save and then look at local storage
